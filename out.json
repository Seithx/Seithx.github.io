            "text": "# The Spider Chart and the Slippery Slope of a \"Quick\" Project\n\nA new request landed on my plate last week: automate the 5S audit process. Right now, it’s painfully manual. An employee walks to 10-12 different locations with a paper form, fills it out, then trudges back to a computer to type everything into Excel. After that, they have to manually calculate the results and email them to the right people. It’s a 15-30 minute time sink per person, which is especially ironic since this is for our Operational Excellence (OPEX) team.\n\nNaturally, I thought, \"Easy fix! I can automate that.\" I jumped right in, figuring it would take an hour, tops. Famous last words. That one hour quickly spiraled into many, reminding me (again) that I need to slow down and scope things out properly.\n\nHere’s where I’m at:\n\n*   **The Problem:** The current 5S audit is a manual, paper-based process that wastes a significant amount of time on data entry and reporting.\n*   **The Quick Win:** I successfully replaced the paper forms with a Google Form. Now, employees can complete the audits on their phones, and the data flows directly into a Google Sheet. That part is a definite success.\n*   **The Roadblock:** The automation is stuck. My biggest headache is trying to reliably generate a \"spider chart\" (a radar chart) using Google Apps Script. It’s just not working consistently.\n*   **The Unfinished Business:** Because of the chart issue, the final reports and emails still have to be sent out manually, which defeats half the purpose of the project.\n\nHonestly, this little project has drained a lot more energy than I expected. I see the value in finishing it, and I hate leaving things incomplete, but it’s become a real time-vampire. It's another classic example of how development projects, no matter how small they seem, always have a few surprises waiting for you down the road.\n\n**Next:** Finish this automation… just maybe not this month.\n\n---\n*Tags: automation, Google Apps Script, scope creep, process improvement, 5S, Google Forms*"
