It’s a good reminder that sometimes the best move is to *not* build something, while other times, it’s about rolling up your sleeves to build from the ground up.\n\nAt work, a proactive new colleague in OpEx is improving our 5S process. We were about to build a system to automatically generate a complex progress graph from a massive Excel file. It felt like a lot of effort, so I pushed back with a simple question: does anyone actually need this? After talking to a few managers, the answer was a clear no. We saved ourselves a ton of development time by deciding to just copy-paste the graph quarterly. It’s a huge win for keeping things simple.\n\nHere are a few highlights from the last couple of days:\n\n*   **Challenging requirements is key.** We avoided building a complex, time-consuming feature by validating its necessity with the actual users first. A simple conversation saved us days of work.\n*   **Paying technical debt is a grind.** I'm continuing to write tests for our video analysis project to enable safe refactoring. It’s slow, painstaking work that highlights the cost of starting a project without a solid testing foundation. A lesson learned the hard way.\n*   **Mentoring is incredibly rewarding.** I was supposed to be on a sick day but ended up helping a friend set up his business domain, connect his professional email, and brainstorm his tech and business strategy. He offered to pay, but just helping him get started was payment enough.\n*   **Building from a clean slate feels great.** After wrestling with the messy codebase at work, helping my friend build his website and story from scratch was a breath of fresh air. We got a nice site up, clarified his offerings, and talked about how he can showcase his skills to clients.\n\n### Reflection\n\nIt’s been a lesson in contrasts. At work, we made the right call to avoid a complex feature, but I’m simultaneously feeling the pain of not having a solid foundation on another project. Then, helping my friend was a powerful reminder of how satisfying it is to build things the right way from day one. It’s all part of the learning process.\n\n**Next:** More refactoring and test writing for the video analysis project.\n\n---\n*Tags: testing, refactoring, project management, mentorship, developer life*"
