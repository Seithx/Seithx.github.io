title: "My First AI-Powered Workflow: Automating My Blog"

I’ve been thinking a lot about reducing the friction between having a thought and sharing it here. Writing and formatting posts, even short ones, takes just enough effort to sometimes stop me from doing it. So today, I dove in and built my first real AI-powered workflow: a script that turns my raw notes into a formatted blog post using the Gemini 1.5 Pro API.

It’s one thing to play with AI in a web UI, but it’s another thing entirely to pipe your own text into a model and get a structured, ready-to-publish file back. Seeing my jumbled notes transform into a clean Markdown post felt like actual magic.

Here are a few takeaways from the process:

*   **Prompting is everything.** My first prompt was too simple ("turn this into a blog post"), and the output was generic and robotic. I had to add specific constraints about tone, voice, structure, and word count to get something that actually sounded like me.
*   **The "scaffolding" code matters.** The AI part is cool, but you still need a solid script to read a source file, make the API call, handle potential errors, and write the formatted output to a new `.md` file. Getting that plumbing right was half the battle.
*   **Iteration is fast.** The feedback loop is incredibly tight. I could tweak the prompt, re-run the script, and see the results in seconds. This made it really fun to dial in the final output.
*   **It's a "force multiplier."** This simple script doesn't replace the thinking, but it completely removes the tedious formatting and editing steps. It makes me *want* to write more because the barrier is so much lower.

This little project was a huge win. It’s a practical tool that I’ll use regularly, and it demystified a lot of the process of integrating AI into a personal workflow. It feels less like a novelty and more like a genuinely useful new tool in my developer toolkit.

**Next:** I'm going to experiment with adding a voice-to-text pipeline so I can go from spoken thoughts to a draft post.
